= Demonstrating Retail example applications

Up until now the Retail validated pattern has focused primarily on
successfully deploying the architectural pattern. Now it is time to see
the actual applications running as we have deployed them.

If you have already deployed the hub cluster, then you have already seen
several applications deployed in the OpenShift GitOps console. If you
havenâ€™t done this then we recommend you deploy the hub after you have
setup the Quay repositories described below.

== Ordering Items at the Coffeeshop

The easiest way to get to the coffeeshop store page is from the
OpenShift Console Menu Landing Page entry:

1. Click the *Quarkus Coffeeshop Landing Page* link will bring you to
this page:

2. Select either the `Store Web Page` or "`TEST Store Web Page`"
links brings you to a screen that looks like this:

[NOTE]
====
The applications are initially identical. The `TEST`" site is
deployed to the `quarkuscoffeeshop-demo` namespace; the regular Store
site is deployed to the `quarkuscoffeeshop-store` namespace.

Each store requires supporting services, in PostgreSQL and Kafka. In our
pattern, PostgreSQL is provided by the Crunchy PostgreSQL operator, and
Kafka is provided by the Red Hat AMQ Streams operator. Each instance,
the regular instance and the TEST instance, has its own instance of each
of these supporting services it uses.

. Order by clicking the `Place an Order` button on the front page. The
menu should look like this:

. Click the `Add` button next to a menu item; the item name will appear.
Add a name for the order:

You can add as many orders as you want. On your last item, click the
"`Place Order`" button on the item dialog:

link:/images/retail/retail-v1-place-order.png[image:/images/retail/retail-v1-place-order.png[retail-v1-place-order]]

As the orders are serviced by the barista and kitchen services, you can
see their status in the "`Orders`" section of the page:
