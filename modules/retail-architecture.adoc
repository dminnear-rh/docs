The following diagram shows the relationship between the microservices,
messaging, and database components:

* The hub. This cluster hosts the CI/CD pipelines, a test instance of the applications and messaging/database services for testing purposes, and a single functional store.
* Optional remote clusters. Each remote site can support a complete store environment. The default one modelled is a "`RALEIGH`" store location.

== Demo Scenario

The Retail Validated Pattern/Demo Scenario showcases the Quarkus Coffeeshop retail experience. Rather than modeling the complexities of a full retail environment—such as item files, tax tables, and inventory management—it focuses on a subset of services to illustrate data flow, microservice interaction through APIs, messaging, and data persistence.

* Web Service - the point of sale within the store. Shows the menu, and allows the user to order food and drinks, and shows when orders are ready.
* Counter service - the "`heart`" of the store operation - receives orders and dispatches them to the barista and kitchen services, as appropriate. Users may order as many food and drink items in one order as they wish.
* Barista - the service responsible for providing items from the
"`drinks`" side of the menu.
* Kitchen - the service responsible for providing items from the
"`food`" side of the menu.

Further documentation on the individual services is available at the upstream https://quarkuscoffeeshop.github.io/[Quarkus Coffeeshop] documentation site.
