= Deploying the retail pattern

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console].
 ** Select *OpenShift \-> Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`. Verify that a dynamic StorageClass exists before creating one by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PROVISIONER:.provisioner,DEFAULT:.metadata.annotations."storageclass\.kubernetes\.io/is-default-class"
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      PROVISIONER       DEFAULT
gp2-csi   ebs.csi.aws.com   <none>
gp3-csi   ebs.csi.aws.com   true
----
+
For more information about creating a dynamic `StorageClass`, see the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html[Dynamic provisioning] documentation.

* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* Optional: A quay account that can update images; this is if you want to use the pipelines to customize the applications.
* Optional: A quay account with the following repositories set as public, and which you can write to:
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-barista
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-counter
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-inventory
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-web
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-customerloyalty
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-kitchen
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-majestic-monolith
** quay.io/your-quay-username/quarkuscoffeeshop-monolith

[NOTE]
====
These repos contain the demo's microservices. The public repos (`quay.io/hybridcloudpatterns/*`) provide pre-built images used by default, allowing the demo to run without rebuilding the apps. Creating your own quay copies offers transparency and lets you reproduce results or customize the apps.
====

* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns/retail[retail] repository on GitHub.

. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:your-username/retail.git
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials. Run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret.yaml
----

. Edit `values-secret.yaml` populating with your quay `username` and `password`. 
+
[source,yaml]
----
# NEVER COMMIT THESE VALUES TO GIT
version: "2.0"
secrets:
    # These are credentials to allow you to push to your image registry (quay.io) for application images
  - name: imageregistry
    fields:
    # eg. Quay -> Robot Accounts -> Robot Login
    - name: username
      value: "my-quay-username"
    - name: password
      value: "my-quay-password"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
====

. Customize the deployment for your cluster by following these steps:

.. Create a new branch named my-branch and switch to it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git switch -c my-branch
----

.. Edit the `values-hub.yaml` file to customize the deployment for your cluster by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi values-global.yaml
----
+
The defaults should suffice if you just want to see the apps running. The values that you might change are under the `imageregistry`, if you copied the images to your own quay account and hostname. If you like, you can change the `git` settings of `account`, `email` and `hostname` to reflect your own account settings.
+
If you plan to customize the build of the applications themselves, there are `revision` and `imageTag` settings for each of them. 

.. Stage the changes to the `values-hub.yaml` file by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git add values-global.yaml
----

.. Commit the changes to the `values-hub.yaml` file by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git commit -m "update deployment for my-branch"
----

.. Push the changes to the `values-global.yaml` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git push origin my-branch
----

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator].

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the pattern by using the pattern.sh script

To deploy the pattern by using the `pattern.sh` script, complete the following steps:

. Log in to your cluster by running the following:

.. Obtain an API token by visiting https://oauth-openshift.apps.<your-cluster>.<domain>/oauth/token/request

.. Log in with this retrieved token by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --token=<retrieved-token> --server=https://api.<your-cluster>.<domain>:6443
----

. Alternatively log in by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./pattern.sh make install
----

[id="verify-trvlops-pattern-install"]
== Verify the retail pattern installation

. Verify that the Operators have been installed.

 .. To verify, in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Operators â†’ Installed Operators* page.

 .. Set your project to `All Projects` and verify the operators are installed and have a status of `Succeeded`.

. Track the progress through the Hub ArgoCD UI from the nines menu:
+
image:/images/retail/retail-v1-console-menu.png[retail-v1-console-menu]

. Ensure that the Hub ArgoCD instance shows all of its apps in Healthy and Synced status once all of the images have been built:
+
link:/images/retail/retail-v1-argo-apps-p1.png[image:/images/retail/retail-v1-argo-apps-p1.png[retail-v1-argo-apps-p1]

. Check on the pipelines, if you chose to run them. They should all complete successfully:
+
link:/images/retail/retail-v1-pipelines.png[image:/images/retail/retail-v1-pipelines.png[retail-v1-pipelines]

. Go to the *Quarkus Coffeeshop Landing Page* where you are presented with the applications in the pattern:
+
link:/images/retail/retail-v1-landing-page.png[image:/images/retail/retail-v1-landing-page.png[retail-v1-landing-page]

. Click the *Store Web Page* to open the Quarkus Coffeeshop Demo:
+
link:/images/retail/retail-v1-store-page.png[image:/images/retail/retail-v1-store-page.png[retail-v1-store-page]

. Click the *TEST Store Web Page* to open a separate copy of the same demo.

. Clicking the respective *Kafdrop* links to go to a Kafdrop instance that allows inspection of each of the respective environments.
