= About the retail pattern

This pattern demonstrates a pattern that models the store side of a retail application.

It is derived from the https://quarkuscoffeeshop.github.io[Quarkus Coffeeshop Demo] created by Red Hat Solution Architects. The demo showcases the use of multiple microservices that interact through Kafka messaging and persist data in a PostgreSQL database. 

This demo pulls together several different strands of the demo and allows for multiple stores to be installed on remote clusters via ACM if the user desires.

The demo allows users to go to the storeâ€™s web page, order drinks and food items, and see those items `made` and served by the microservices in real time.

The pattern includes build pipelines and a demo space, so that changes to the applications can be tested prior to `production` deployments.
