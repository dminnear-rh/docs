== Having a store (edge) cluster join the datacenter (hub)

=== Allow ACM to deploy the store application to a subset of clusters

A store ("`ATLANTA`") is installed on the hub cluster by default. This feature is interesting if you want to see how ACM can manage a remote
cluster to install the same application on a different cluster.

The way we apply this is through the `managedClusterGroups` block in `values-hub.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  managedClusterGroups:
    raleigh:
      name: store-raleigh
      helmOverrides:
      # Values must be strings!
      - name: clusterGroup.isHubCluster
        value: "false"
      clusterSelector:
        matchLabels:
          clusterGroup: store-raleigh
        matchExpressions:
        - key: vendor
          operator: In
          values:
            - OpenShift
----

Any cluster joined with the label `clusterGroup=store-raleigh` is assigned the policies that deploy the store app to them.

=== Attaching a managed cluster (edge) to the management hub

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. 

When you install the retail GitOps pattern, a hub cluster is setup. The hub cluster serves as the central point for managing and deploying applications across multiple clusters.

== Verification

. Go to your managed cluster (edge) OpenShift console and check for the `open-cluster-management-agent` pod being launched. 

[NOTE]
====
It might take a while for the RHACM agent and `agent-addons` to launch.

=== Store is joined

==== Youâ€™re done

That is it! Go to your store (edge) OpenShift console and check for the open-cluster-management-agent pod being launched. Be patient, it will
take a while for the ACM agent and agent-addons to launch. After that, the operator OpenShift GitOps will run. When it is finished coming up
launch the OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) console from the top right of the
OpenShift console.
