# OpenShift Regional Disaster Recovery

## About OpenShift Regional Disaster Recovery

As more and more institution and mission critical organizations are moving 
in the cloud, the possible impact of having a provider failure, might this be
only related to only one region, is very high.

This pattern is designed to prove the resiliency capabilities of Red Hat Openshift 
in such scenario. 

The Regional Disaster Recovery Pattern, is designed to setup an multiple instances 
of Openshift Container Platform cluster connectedbetween them to prove multi-region 
resiliency by maintaing the application running in the event of a regional failure. 

In this scenario we will be working in a  Regional Disaster Recovery setup, and the 
synchronization parameters can be specified in the value file. 

NOTE: please consider using longer times if you have a large dataset or very long 
distances between the clusters

## Background

The _Regional DR Validated Pattern for [Red Hat OpenShift][ocp]_ increases the resiliency
of your applications by connecting multiple clusters across different regions. This pattern
uses [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management][acm] to offer a
[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation][odf]-based multi-region disaster recovery plan if an
entire region fails.

[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation][odf] offers two solutions for disaster
recovery: [Metro DR][mdr] and [Regional DR][rdr]. As their name suggests, _Metro
DR_ refers to a metropolitan area disasters, which occur when the disaster
covers only a single area in a region (availability zone), and _Regional DR_
refers to when the entire region fails.  Currently, only active-passive mode is
supported.

A word on synchronization. A metropolitan network generally offers less latency;
data can be written to multiple targets simultaneously, a feature required for
active-active DR designs. On the other hand, writing to multiple targets in a
cross-regional network might introduce unbearable latency to data
synchronization and our applications. Therefore, _Regional DR_ can only work
with active-passive DR designs, where the targets are replicated
asynchronously.

The synchronization between Availability Zones is faster and can be performed
synchronous. However, in order don't include a lot of latency on the data
synchronization process, when data is replicated across regions, it necessary
includes latencies based on the distance between both regions (e.g. The latency
between two regions on Europe, will always be less than between Europe and Asia,
so consider this when designing your infrastructure deployment on the values
files of the pattern). This is the main reason because this RegionalDR is
configured in an Active-Passive mode.

It requires an already existing Openshift cluster, which will be used for installing the
pattern, deploying active and passive clusters manage the application
scheduling.

### Prerequisites

Installing this pattern requires:
* One online [Red Hat OpenShift][ocp] cluster to become the "Manager" cluster.
This cluster will orchestrate application deployments and data synchronizations.
* Connection to a Cloud Provider (AWS/Azure/GCP) configured in the Manager
cluster. This is required for deploying the active and passive [OCP][ocp]
clusters.
* [Red Hat OpenShift CLI][cli] installed

### Solution elements

The _Regional DR Pattern_ leverages [Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation][odf]'s
[Regional DR][rdr] solution, automating applications failover between
[Red Had Advanced Cluster Management][acm] managed clusters in different regions.

- The pattern is kick-started by ansible and uses ACM to overlook and orchestrate the process 
- The demo application uses MongoDB writing its data on a Persistent Volume Claim backe by ODF
- We have developed a DR trigger which will be used to start the DR process 
- The end user needs to configure which PV's need synchronization and the latencies 
- ACS Can be used for eventual policies 
- The clusters are connected by submariner and, to have a faster recovery time, we suggest having 
  hybernated clusters ready to be used

## Installation
This patterns is designed to be installed in an Openshift cluster which will
work as the orchestrator for the other clusters involved. The Adanced Cluster Manager 
installed will neither run the applications nor store any data from them, but it
will take care of the plumbing of the various clusters involved, 
coordinating their communication and orchestrating when and where an application is 
going to be deployed.

As part of the pattern configuration, the administrator needs to define both
clusters installation details as would be done using the Openshift-installer
binary.

For installing the pattern, follow the next steps:
1. Fork the _Pattern_.
2. Describe the instructions for creating the clusters and syncing data between them.
3. Commit and push your changes (to your fork).
4. Set your **secret** cloud provider credentials.
5. Connect to your target _Hub_ cluster.
6. Install the _Pattern_.
7. Start deploying [resilient applications][rdr].


### Pattern Configuration

For a full example, check the _Pattern_'s [values.yaml][yml]. The install-config
specifications are detailed [here][cfg].

Detailed configuration instructions can be found [here][rrp].
